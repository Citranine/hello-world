# hello-world

Hello all!

My name is Citranine. I took a web design class in high school and have been hooked ever since!

I'm mainly interested in html and css, but I'm trying to learn more.
I have been a hobbyist for about four years now and have built multiple websites just for fun.
I love webistes that allow a user to customize their user page via html. I think it is a good way to encourage creativity!
